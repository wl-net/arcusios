/// A handy utility to make a view controller vertically scrollable without the heinous complexity
/// of getting all the storyboard constraints working correctly.
///
/// How to use:
///   1. Create a view controller in the storyboard as you normally would, then
///   2. Assign this class as the storyboard's view controller, or have your own custom view
///      controller extend this class.
///   3. Marvel in the fact that you didn't have to spend hours futzing with stupid constraints.
///
/// This utility calculates the smallest vertical size of its contents that meets the layout
/// constraints even if that vertical size is larger the viewport height of the containing view
/// controller. If the resized height is smaller than the containing view controller's height, then
/// this class has no affect on layout (i.e., your contents don't need to scroll). However, if the
/// resized height exceeds available screen real estate, then this view controller's view is placed
/// inside of a UIScrollView and provisioned for vertical-only scrolling. In order for this utility
/// to correctly calculate the scrollable height, each element in your layout should be vertically
/// constrained to one another.
///
/// Consider a VC with two views: a label with a very large amout of text pinned to the top safe area
/// guide and button pinned to the bottom of the safe area guide (with no constraints tieing the
/// label to the button). If you apply this utility to such a layout on a very small screen, the
/// result will be the top label runs over the bottom button (and potentially clipped off the bottom
/// of screen) and there will be no scroll applied.
///
/// FAQS:
///
/// Can I have buttons that stay pinned to the bottom of the screen on large devices, but scroll
/// beneith the contents on smaller devices?
///
///   Yep. Piece of cake: Pin your bottom buttons to the bottom of the VC. This will address the
///   large-screen device cases. Then, apply a second "greater-than-or-equals" constraint between the
///   top of your pinned buttons and bottom of the contents they should sit below (this should
///   represent the minimum amount of margin you want between the buttons and contents on small screen
///   devices). Finally, assign this '>=' constraint a lower priority (typically 750) so the layout
///   manager can break it on large screen devices.
///
///   In general, I've been able to apply this tool to existing (non-scrolling) layouts where one or
///   more buttons are pinned to the bottom of the screen by simply adding this one '>=' constraint
///   to the preexisting storyboard layout.
